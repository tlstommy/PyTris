### What you accomplished

During sprint 2, I worked more on polishing the server for integration with the pytris client. I talked with Henry about what we should do and how we should link the two together. I also added a simple but hopefully non permanant solution to the firewall issue as well as created a signals function for events like game over and player disconnect.
