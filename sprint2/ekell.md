### What you accomplished

During Sprint 2, I worked with the user interface. I added text-boxes to the main menu that allow the user to enter a username and a server ip address. This will later be used when communicating between the client and the server. I also added a very basic settings menu; as of now, the settings window is only for looks. Also, for Sprint 2 I reformatted the game window by adjusting things to look more uniform, such as adding a place for opponent level, lines, and score.
