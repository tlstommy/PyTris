### What you accomplished
During sprint 4, I worked more on trying to get the server to work with signals. I implemented a fix so that the server will not crash the first time a client connects and worked on integrating it further with the client. We discovered that it may not be possible for the program to work on the UT network due to socket rules listed here:https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Sockets/lecture.html, however it works fine on personal home networks.
