There will be many options within settings, such as shape packs, to modify the game experience; sounds, to adjust music and sound effects volume; network, to switch between single-player and multiplayer; controls, to modify key presses;and backgrounds, to change visuals. To start a game, the user will be prompted for a username and a server ip address; upon entering the fields, the user will be placed at a wait screen until the other player is connected. During the course of the game, the user will be able to see their level, lines cleared, score, and all of their opponent's information as well. Once the game is completed, the user will be placed back at the main menu.
