### What you accomplished

During Sprint 4, I worked with the user interface again. I added a controls menu that allows the user to set their delayed-auto-shift time. I also added a network menu that allows the user to toggle between multiplayer and singleplayer. In addition, I added buttons to all of the menus so that the user is not limited to using the keyboard. For example on the main menu, the user has the choice to press ENTER to play or click the "Play" button now. I also fixed issues with the clear line function.
