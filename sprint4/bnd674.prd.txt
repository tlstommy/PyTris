# Product Requirements Document
Name: Thomas Smith

Product Name: VoiceCards

## Background
The problem with most study apps are that there is not a safe, legal way to use them while stuck in traffic or on the drive to class, which are both great places to study as there is nothing else going on. This use of voice recognition is a perfect solution to this problem for peaople such as students.

## Project Overview
My project idea would be an app or website called VoiceCards. VoiceCards would be a learning app, like quizlet, that uses flash cards as study sets. The primary diffrence between my project VoiceCards and something like quizlet is something that I belive quizlet is missing, voice recoginition. VoiceCard would be able to read aloud flash cards and be able to hear and understand what the user says in response and determine if they have the right answer to the question.
users would be able to: 
- make custom flashcard sets
- read out flashcards and listen for correct responses
- normal flashcard mode
- use the app for free but have it funded by ads
- create groups of sets (sort of like a classroom)

overall if this project were to me made i think that now would be a perfect time for it as quizlet has just started to monitize and restrict the service.
