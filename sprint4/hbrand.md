### What you accomplished
I tested a rework of the server to handle the game ending, sending garbage, and taking signals for the game ending and user names with Daniel(many of my commits are shared with Daniel, we worked together). 
I also added the option to play singleplayer and made the loading screen disappear immediately as two players connect.
As a result, the game crashes far less, players can now interact with garbage, and the game finishes properly.
