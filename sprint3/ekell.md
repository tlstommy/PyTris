### What you accomplished

During Sprint 3, I worked with the user interface again. I made settings functional; now, volume, background, and shape pack can be configured by the user. To go along with that, I created separate windows for each of the applicable settings listed. Additionally, I created a waiting screen that will appear after a player inputs their username and ip address; this will allow the client to wait until both players have connected to start the game.
