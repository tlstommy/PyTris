# Sprint 1

Henry Brand - hbrandutk - PyTris

### What I planned to do
1. Seven bag randomizer
2. Piece hold
3. Five piece previews

### What problems you encountered
I never really encountered any problems when working on my tasks, everything went more or less smooth. I was able to get in some extra features I wasn't even planning for as well.

### Issues you worked on
[#1] https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/PyTris/issues/9
[#2] https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/PyTris/issues/8
[#3] https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/PyTris/issues/7

### Files you worked on
- pytris.py
### What you accomplished
I added more functionality and features to the game itsself and the client. I added the ability to hold a piece with the left shift key for later use, a better piece randomizer that is more fair than a 100% random randomizer, and a display for the next 5 upcoming pieces in the new queue function. I also added a left and 180 rotation key for quality of life.
