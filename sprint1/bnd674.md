- create a demo server that can talk to a demo client. Issue #1: https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/PyTris/issues/1






### What you did not do
I accomplished all my planned issues.

### What problems you encountered

- Sometimes the sockets library can be blocked by a computers firewall or antivirus software.
- Data needs to be encoded properly to be sent and received.
- Diffrent players from the same ip can cause duplicate issues.

### What you accomplished

During sprint 1 I was able to get a barebones, yet successful server and client working together. The server is able to distinguish users on the same ip with a basic ID system of username+ip and can serve opponents boards to players and is structured in a way that hopefully will be scaleable. The server is able to talk to diffrent clients over a network and transfer JSON data. I also helped a little bit with figuring out how to get the client to work with two boards at once.
