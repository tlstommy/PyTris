### What you accomplished

During sprint1 I was able to structure the main code to be prepared to send and recieve data from an opponent player. This was done by formatting an opponent class, establishing different data types, and beginning communication between client and server. In addition I was able to communicate well with my team on what needed to be accomplished and what needs to be worked on in the future.
