### What you accomplished

During Sprint 1, I added features to the base game. I added score and lines cleared, along with increasing levels. These features are displayed and updated as the game is played, giving the player more insight on the state of the game. I also added background music and sound effects to the game. The current sound effects include: clear, tetris, level up, and game over. Additionally, I worked on various smaller issues, such as fixing the display of the next pieces, so it did not overlap other displays.
